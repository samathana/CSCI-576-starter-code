All of my code is inside Main.cpp, so simply replace the Main.cpp from the
skeleton code. I have done my extra credit, so you can test with 4 or 5 arguments.
The arguments are printed in the terminal, followed by the calculated pivot value
(if not specified), and then the red values that were used. So you may have
to scroll up to see the pivot. Thank you grader :3
